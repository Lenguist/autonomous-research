It would be amazing if AI could make scientific discoveries on its own.

Unlike my other ideas (link to movie generation idea) this idea seems like an obvious net-positive for humanity.
The only risks are the existential risks, but those are associated with any AI with a great enough autonomy, so not specific to the application.

How can we do it?

Purely on a technical standpoint, chatGPT seems to be smart enough to have an in-depth understanding of many scientific concepts, and thus potentially capable of making a discovery. However, as of now, it lacks:

- almost all real world interaction which severly limits its ability to experiment
- curiosity to explore and experiment
- ability to notice a discovery

UNSTRUCTURED THOUGHTS:
Theoretically however it is possible to build something like that. Give chatgpt access to some real world environment/simulation (say a chemical simualtion engine). Create some outer curiosity-like loop which would push agent to look for unexpected things. When there is an expected thing follow scientfic method to explore it.
